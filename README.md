# Default Template MVN Java with tests
> This is a default template for neue fische projects of cgn-java-22-1

## Usage
See [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

Both classes ToDelete.java and DeleteThisClassTest can be used to see if project is working from scratch. However, when starting a new project deleting these files is a good idea.
